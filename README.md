# Text-Editor

## Description
For this challenge we were asked to make a text editor that can be downloadable using PWA. This challenge was pretty challenging for me personally.

## Installation
For this challenge we were asked to make a text editor using PWA. The first thing I worked on was the app install, and the database.js where openDB was implemented to make a jateDB. Then lastly I worked on the webpack config so the dist file is implemented correctly.

## Usage 
Once user navigates to the jate page they are presented with an install button where the application can be downloaded and installed. Or the application can be used in the browser.
